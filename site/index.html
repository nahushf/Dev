            <b>Approach followed</b> -
            <br /> The logic behind this implementation is as follows
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each piece of data fetched from the stomp connection is first parsed and the mid price, and sparkline array of values for
                    that piece of data is calculated
                </li>
                <li>
                    This data is stored in a collection
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now on the subsequent data fetched by stomp, the existing collection is checked for the presence of data for and entity with
                    the same name. If data already exists, the same object is updated with new values. Else a fresh object
                    is pushed into the collection
                </li>
                <li>
                    The collection data structure also stores a sorted array representation of all the records fetched so far
                </li>
                <li>
                    This array representation is used to construct the html for the table and this html is then attached to the table node in
                    html
                </li>
                <li>
                    As an extra I am also highlighting the elements whose lastChangeBig value is either increasing(green) or decreasing (red)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Prospective libraries which would have made the development experience better</b>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Typescript</b> - The type system provided by typescript helps eliminate a large number of common compile
                    time errors which end up occupying a lot of time
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>React</b> - The implementation right now constructs the dom for the entire table, even if the data for
                    the records has not changed. This introduces a certain degree of wasteful dom operations. React would
                    be perfect to remove these wasteful operations. The virtual dom implemented by React would only update
                    those nodes in the html which have changed whenever the data changes
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What could be improved in this code:</b>
            <br> I am aware that this code is nowhere near perfect, but this is the best I could produce given the time I had
            at my disposal. Here are the possible improvements that I would have worked on, If had some more time on my hands.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The sorted array returned by the collection data structure could be compared with the previously generated array to assess
                    exactly which rows have changed and only those rows could be re-rendered. This would reduce the expensive
                    dom operations
                </li>
                <li>
                    After completing this code, I realized that the approach I followed could be tweaked a bit more. Instead of using separate
                    data structures for each object and for the collection as a whole, I believe simply operating on the
                    JSON parsed form of the data in a simple array would have perhaps improved the overall readability of
                    the code
                </li>
                <li>
                    The code implementation first constructs the table html in a string, then attaches it to the DOM and then individually attaches
                    the sparkline component for each row. The sparkline component can be modified to return the svg in a
                    string format so that the table html can be constructed with the sparkline svg and rendered all at once.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test cases could be added to improve the robustness of the code
                </li>
            </ul>
